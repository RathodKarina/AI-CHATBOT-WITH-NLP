Chat, reflections: Prebuilt classes from NLTK for creating simple rule-based chatbots. FPDF: Python library to generate PDF files. datetime: Used to get the current date for the certificate. These are regular expression (regex)-based pattern-response pairs.The bot checks user input against these patterns and gives predefined responses.Initializes and starts the chatbot session using Chat.converse() from NLTK.
reflections handles simple "I/you" reversals, e.g., "I am" ↔ "you are" (optional here).Uses the FPDF library to create a formatted certificate. Adds a title, a formatted message, and the current date.
Saves the file as CodTech_Certificate.pdf.Asks for the user’s name.Starts the chatbot.When the chatbot ends (user types exit, etc.), generates the certificate using the given name.
